JLearnIt is a thematic dictionary that allows you to learn vocabulary thanks to the questionnaire. 
        You can also translate text (word by word) or search for incomplete words, sort the languages to get it in alphabetical order, rearrange the order of the languages, save your score, save as HTML, show only the languages you're interested in. Each word has a level often used(1) to technical word(10). 
        You can choose to see only the words of a certain range of level or to be asked for words of that level. 
        You can also add and delete your vocabulary and categories, cut/copy/paste even between your spreadsheet program and JLearnIt. 
        You can change the language and the skin of JLearnIt. 
        You can get more information about the word on the Internet, save your configuration. 
        JLearnIt won't ask you the same word if you know the word (you can change the settings about what 'know' means for you). It won't ask you for the word that starts with the same letters as the translation. 
        You can edit words and set properties for this word.
        The languages available are English, French, Spanish, Dutch, German, Italian, Hebrew, Portuguese, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Hungarian, Russian, Latin and Czech.

        You can choose another file than the vocabulary from the Internet or your hard disk. (French departments, Morse code, ...). 
        You can also create a new file for you.</description>
