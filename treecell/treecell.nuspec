Treecell is a software that represents your data from Excel or CSV from a table to a navigatable tree. 
        You can expand and collapse same value to easily find data.
        Rearrange the column orders and which columns to show or hide.
        By default all is collapsed, so it's easier to show data only from a specific group and leave the other data confidential/hidden.
        You can also show statistics on selected nodes.
        Show the window always on top and translucent.
        
        Commercial: Free to try for one day.</description>
